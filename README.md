![ezgif-3-286e1fe193](https://github.com/seddboi/BlackJack-Python-Game/assets/75237411/1703f7c7-4dd4-4ea9-bb29-0dad4b50f395)

## Introduction

If you know the casino game of Blackjack, then you'll know this computerized version of it via your terminal command line! This terminal Blackjack game follows the same rules as real life Casino Blackjack, yet it is all text based!

## Development

I started with the basics of understanding how the game functions, in order to correctly wirte the game logic. After countless video explaining different ups and downs of Casino Blackjack, I managed to write logic to cover ever scenario:

- Player wins and Dealer loses
- Dealer wins and player loses
- Ties
- Player is dealt a Blackjack and instantly wins

Just like at the casinos, the game's outcome depends on the users move first. If the user goes over 21 on their turn before the dealer, then they instantly lose the game (regardless of the dealer's hand).

Once full game logic was flawless, I established formatting for the game text to make it much easier to read and understand what was happening in the game. This allows the user to feel like they had much more control of their choices and options (given that this game is all virtual).

## How to play:

1. Fork this repo onto your local computer
2. Install python3 on your computer (if not already installed)
3. Open up your terminal/command line
4. Navigate to the newly copied Blackjack folder's directory on your computer
5. Run this command:
   `python3 Blackjack.py`

Happy Playing! More updates to come in the future!
